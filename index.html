        </a></p>
      <p>For our E-mobility Bike we had to create a box to store all the components for the bike. This box has to be
        stable and easily dismandtable this is because if there is an error you will be able to unscrew and fix the
        wiring.

        </a></p>
      <p>We were tasked to build an E-mobility bike. This bike would be an inexpensive and sustainable option. For
        instance being able to bike to and from school, work, or any other endeavor. In this instructable we explain our
        process from attaching the motor, to building housing for the system and adding extra functions.

        </a></p>
      <p>My app is to educate children about the different species that live in the forest. While also teaching them
        about
        the harm of trash in the environment. In this video, you can see a start screen prompting the user to click
        play.
        Once you are in the play menu telling you about the biome, which is a forest, saying that not everything in the
        forest is meant to be touched. After creation is clicked, you are brought into the main game. There are various
        plants and objects scattered around the map. On the top left of the game there is a menu that displays the
        different objects that are able to be clicked on the map. The value of these objects are set to zero. When you
        click on one of these items the variable that is set in the menu is increased by one. The input is when the item
        is clicked, and the output is that variable that was displayed before increased by 1.

      <p>This game was made inspired by a project titled the same way. The object of the game is to draw a maze. Then
        after drawing be able to go make your way to the end. The catch is you are not able to go over walls. The only
        way is to go around them. Click the link above to play!
