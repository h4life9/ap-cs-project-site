      <p>My app is to educate children about the different species that live in the forest. While also teaching them
        about
        the harm of trash in the environment. In this video, you can see a start screen prompting the user to click
        play.
        Once you are in the play menu telling you about the biome, which is a forest, saying that not everything in the
        forest is meant to be touched. After creation is clicked, you are brought into the main game. There are various
        plants and objects scattered around the map. On the top left of the game there is a menu that displays the
        different objects that are able to be clicked on the map. The value of these objects are set to zero. When you
        click on one of these items the variable that is set in the menu is increased by one. The input is when the item
        is clicked, and the output is that variable that was displayed before increased by 1.
